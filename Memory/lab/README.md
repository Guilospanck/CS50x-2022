# Bitmap
Basically a Bitmap image is as the name suggests: a map of bits.

For a Black And White image, we have only one bit representing each pixel. 1 for white and 0 for black.

For a colorful image, usually a 24-bit image, we have 8 bits (1 byte) representing each color and 24-bit (8 bytes) representing each pixel.

The pixel, then, is a composition of the amount of three different colors: Red, Green and Blue (RGB).
